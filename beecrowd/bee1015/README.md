# Distance Between Two Points


Read the four values corresponding to the x and y axes of two points in the plane, p1 (x1, y1) and p2 (x2, y2) and 
calculate the distance between them, showing four decimal places, according to the formula:

$$
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
$$


## Input
The input file contains two lines of data. The first one contains two double values: **x1 y1** and the second one 
also contains two double values with one digit after the decimal point: **x2 y2**.

## Output
Calculate and print the distance value using the provided formula, with 4 decimal places.
